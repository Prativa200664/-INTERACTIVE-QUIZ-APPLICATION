An interactive quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a web-based tool that allows users to participate in quizzes by answering a series of questions and receiving instant feedback. The structure of the application is built using HTML, while CSS is used to create a clean, responsive, and visually appealing interface. JavaScript powers the core functionality, including loading questions, handling user input, evaluating answers, displaying correct or incorrect responses, and tracking scores in real time. The quiz typically presents one question at a time, highlights the correct answer after each selection, and displays the final score at the end. This kind of application is ideal for educational purposes, online assessments, internships, and learning platforms, offering an engaging way to test knowledge interactively without the need for page reloads or external tools.
